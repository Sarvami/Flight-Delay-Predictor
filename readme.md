Perfect! A **README** will make your project professional and easy for anyone to understand or run. Here’s a complete example you can drop into your project folder as `README.md`:

# Flight Delay Predictor

## **Overview**

This project predicts **flight arrival delays** using historical flight data.
It includes:

* Data cleaning and feature engineering in a **Jupyter Notebook**.
* A **Random Forest regression model** to predict arrival delay in minutes.
* A **Streamlit app** for users to input flight details and get delay predictions.

## **Dataset**

* The dataset contains historical flight records with columns such as:
  `Year, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, DepTime, CRSDepTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay, Distance, UniqueCarrier, Origin, Dest, …`
* Features used for modeling:

  * `Distance`
  * `DepDelay`
  * `CRS_DEP_HOUR` (scheduled departure hour)
  * Carrier dummies (`UniqueCarrier`)

---

## **How to Run the Notebook**

1. Open `flight_delay_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. The model (`delay_model.pkl`) will be saved in the `models/` folder.

---

## **How to Run the Streamlit App**

1. Navigate to the `app/` folder in terminal:

```bash
cd app
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. The app sidebar allows you to input:

   * Distance (miles)
   * Departure Delay (minutes)
   * Scheduled Departure Hour (0–23)
   * Carrier

4. The app outputs the **predicted arrival delay in minutes**.

---

## **Optional Enhancements**

* Include **Weekday** as a feature when retraining the model.
* Add **“Is Delayed?”** classification (>15 minutes).
* Improve UI/UX in the Streamlit app with charts or color-coded outputs.

---

## **Dependencies**

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* joblib
* streamlit

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib streamlit
```
